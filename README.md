# Near Go Warchest Bot.
This tool/service dynamically maintaining no more than one seat and export metrics for [monitoring](https://prometheus.io). It uses [JSON-RPC](https://docs.near.org/docs/interaction/rpc) and [Near Shell](https://github.com/near/near-shell/) command line interface.

## Features

- Dynamically maintaining one seat 
- Supporting multi delegate accounts
- ping() with a new epoch
- Prometheus metrics
- Docker

## Install Docker
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt install docker.io
```

## Usage

### Docker

- Download only [env2.list file](https://github.com/rozum-dev/near-go-warchest/blob/test/env2.list) in any directory ( */home/root/near-go-warchest* for example)
> **IMPORTANTS!!!** All commands need run in directory, where you saved env2.list file!!!

- sudo docker pull dmytro1rozum/go-warchest:tagname (download docker image)

- sudo docker run -dti --restart always --volume $HOME/near/.near-credentials:/root/.near-credentials --name go-warchest --network=host --env-file env2.list -p 9444:9444 dmytro1rozum/go-warchest:latest /dist/go-warchest -accountId <YOUR_POOL_ID>  -delegatorId <YOUR_DELEGATOR_ID>
> make sure you have a keys of your delegator account at `$HOME/.near-credential`.
> you can use multiple **delegatorId** one after the other ( sudo docker run ........ -delegatorId <YOUR_DELEGATOR1_ID> -delegatorId <YOUR_DELEGATOR2_ID> )

- it's all. To check, run **sudo docker logs go-warchest -f**, and if you want to destroy, run **sudo docker rm go-warchest -f**



### Without Docker

Intall and/or update Go. You need to have 1.13 at least
https://medium.com/@khongwooilee/how-to-update-the-go-version-6065f5c8c3ec

You have to install [Near Shell](https://github.com/near/near-shell/).

Make sure you have a keys of your delegator account at `$HOME/.near-credential`.

    git clone https://github/masknetgoal634/near-go-warchest

    cd near-go-warchest

    set -a
    source env.list
    set +a

    go build go-warchest.go

    ./go-warchest -accountId <YOUR_POOL_ID> -delegatorId <YOUR_DELEGATOR_ID>


By default the near-go-warchest metrics service serves on `:9444` at `/metrics`.

## Prometheus

Here is an example `prometheus.yml`.

```
  - job_name: go-warchest
    scrape_interval: 30s
    static_configs:
